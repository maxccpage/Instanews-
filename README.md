### Learning Outcomes

The Instanews project allowed me to learn and sharpen a multitude of newly aquired skills. The use of Gulp as a task runner for my project allowed me to: run BroswerSync, lint JavaScript files, compile SCSS files into a style.css file, minify my CSS and JavaScript files, and last but not least notify me of any errors made, with messages in my terminal. Additionally, I learned how to pull, parse, and populate content with data that was received from an external web API. Finally, the use of SCSS allowed me to keep a more logically organized style folder using partials, in addition to using @mixins, @extends, as well as simple and logical variables.
